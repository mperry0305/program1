program1
========
A brief summary from a students perspective,
and a common one might I add (underachieving, often misled, young male)
========

So.. this program basically kicked me in the face because I had no idea how to develop a full program,
and now that I've FINALLY completed it, after eons of stressing about it, and not having it work. I sat down,
approached it from a logical standpoint (a.k.a briggs commented the hell out of my code with diligence and was instrumental in
debugging my messy, improperly indented code).

Overall this first program followed me through the entirety of COS 161, and was a very humbling, important experience
in my overall state of being. I appreciate your persistence to stick with me through the semester, and opening my eyes
to world that I've been living in. I can't begin to express my gratitude in anyway that is worthwhile, so I was hoping
this momento from an aspiring developer/young adult could put a smile on your face.

Thank you very much Professor Briggs, though I struggled, and even may fail this course. I am incredibly grateful to the
knowledge and experience you have instilled upon me. When I was able to attend class I was enticed by programming and
your demonstration of control of the subject was mind boggling, but the greatest thing you instilled upon me was humility.
For as great as a developer as you are, each and every day you were happy to point out your faults and openly admitted them.

Very best,
Matthew Perry
